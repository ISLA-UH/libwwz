# libwwz

This library provides functions for computing the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform.

The code is based on G. Foster's FORTRAN code as well as eaydin's python 2.7 code. The code is updated to use numpy methods and allow for float value tau.

Specific equations can be found on Grant Foster's _Wavelets for period analysis of unevenly sampled time series_.
